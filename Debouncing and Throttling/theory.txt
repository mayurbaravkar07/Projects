Debouncing is a technique in JavaScript that is used to 
improve the performance of a website or web application by limiting the
 rate at which a particular function gets executed. This can be especially
  useful when working with events that are triggered frequently, such as window 
  resizing or scrolling, as it allows us to group multiple events together and 
  reduce the number of times that a function needs to be run.
